=================================================================


### Description

Caeser's Cypher is a simple single-letter substitution cypher. The cypher maps each letter in the domain alphabet A_i
onto a letter in a cyclically permuted codomain alphabet A_j, where i, j are indices of A. Since the codomain A_j is a
permutation of A_i the ordering of characters is cyclically preserved, and the frequency of each element a_i  will give
the frequency of the element a_j.

These properties make caeser's cypher very easy to detect and reverse.
